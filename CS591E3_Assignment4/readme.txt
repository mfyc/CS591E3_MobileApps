Notes:

We ran into a few issues with different build versions (Android not resolving the packages) but as of this readme, 
everything was tested and should work properly.

In the worksheet 4 problem 3 project, you can more clearly see the shaking of the text on the home screen by moving the 
phone in the z direction (though you can move it wherever and it should still work anyways, I found z to be the quickest). 
The text on screen will then 'shake' sideways for 2 secs in response.
